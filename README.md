# Shopify_Analysis_PowerBi
Just wrapped up a comprehensive Shopify Sales &amp; Funnel Analysis project!
This analysis evaluates transaction performance, customer behavior, and product trends from Shopify sales data to support data-driven decisions across marketing, sales, and operations.

We analyzed $4.18M in sales, 7,500+ orders, and 4,400+ customers to uncover key business insights:

• 46% of customers were repeat buyers
• $943 average customer lifetime value
• Amazon Pay led with 58% of total sales
• Running shoes topped in both revenue and repeat purchases
• Midnight hours and Day 24 showed peak performance

This data-driven approach helped reveal high-performing products, optimize payment strategies, and identify ideal marketing windows. Excited to keep turning data into decisions!
